  <h1>Test for weirdness with bug N</h1>

  <p>It appears that bug N added a handler to bind all plugins within a link to
    the replacement plugin binding using the rule <tt>a .mainBox</tt>.

  <p>This has the unfortunate side effect of binding any plugin element
    that lives inside a link element, even if it is entirely unrelated to
    the replacement feature.
